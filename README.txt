The goal of this project is to efficiently manipulate large amounts of data using the power of the C
language. To do this, we will create a CDataframe that will handle multiple types of data, such as the
height of a person or the name of his pet. Each column in the dataframe will contain a title, such as
"height", and corresponding data, which can be of different types. We will use structures to represent
each column, allowing both the title and the data to be stored. Using pointer arrays, we will be able
to access each column and dynamically manage memory to store an indefinite amount of data. Main
features will include creating and populating columns, as well as freeing allocated memory. We are
also planning to implement advanced features such as sorting, displaying and dichotomous search.
