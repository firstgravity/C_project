The idea of the project is to create a library that provide different functions that will help a user
to manipulate data through a system of table with column. In a first part we had to create all functions
that create and manipulate a column of data, and then in a second time we create a Dataframe that is a
list of column. With all of that the user will be able to enter his own data and study it through all the
features given by the library.
